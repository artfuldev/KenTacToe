##Description
A basic Tic Tac Toe (TTT) game engine with a vision to be able to present an AI capable of playing Tic Tac Toe with humans on boards upto 255x255 boxes.
Only basic framework has been built.
Game has grid and players and is made up of moves and searches.

##Updates
Efforts are being made to make the source code readble by adding comments wherever required.
* Game fully functional now. Rules are followed, AI picks move (though not the best!). Game ends when win conditions are met. AI to be implemented with minimax or something soon. Version updated to 1.0.
* Table.java now with full commentary.
* All java files are now with full @javadoc commentary. Enjoy learning!

##Visions
* PVS with Alpha Beta Negamax approach envisioned
* Play on any grid size
